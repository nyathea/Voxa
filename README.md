## Key Features

- **Native macOS Experience:** Built with SwiftUI, Voxa integrates seamlessly with macOS features for a polished and fast user interface.
- **Performance-Focused:** Lightweight design ensures low resource usage and high responsiveness.
- **Customizable Interface:** Modify appearance with custom CSS and theming.
- **Advanced Window Management:** Resizable and draggable windows with transparency and aesthetic layouts.
- **Privacy-First Permissions:** Fine-grained microphone, camera, and location access are available only when needed.
- **FakeNitro and other Vencord plugins:** FakeNitro and Apple Emojis have recently been implemented into Voxa and other BetterDiscord/Vencord plugins are expected soon! See [Upcoming Features](#upcoming-features).

## Known Issues

- Some items are fully transparent, lacking any translucency or blur effects.
- Certain items have not been fully integrated with transparent/translucent features.
- Light mode has a few minor, easily resolvable issues.
  - To fix this, your macOS settings need to be the same as your Voxa settings. For example, if I want to use light mode on Voxa, my system settings also need to be on light mode.

# Disclaimer!
Client modifications are against Discord’s Terms of Service.

However, Discord is pretty indifferent about them, and there are no known cases of users getting banned for using client mods! So you should generally be fine as long as you don’t use any plugins that implement abusive behaviour. 

Regardless, if your account is very important to you and getting disabled would be a disaster for you, you should probably not use any client mods (not exclusive to Voxa), just to be safe.

Additionally, make sure not to post screenshots with Voxa in a server where you might get banned for it
