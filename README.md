# Voxa

Voxa is a sleek, lightweight, native macOS Discord client built using SwiftUI. Designed for speed, efficiency, and a modern user experience, it brings the best of Discord to your Mac in a fully optimized package.

## This project is currently not functioning for users with the new Discord UI until the next release.

## Key Features

- **Native macOS Experience:** Built with SwiftUI, Voxa integrates seamlessly with macOS features for a polished and fast user interface.
- **Performance-Focused:** Lightweight design ensures low resource usage and high responsiveness.
- **Customizable Interface:** Modify appearance with custom CSS and theming.
- **Advanced Window Management:** Resizable and draggable windows with transparency and aesthetic layouts.
- **Privacy-First Permissions:** Fine-grained microphone, camera, and location access are available only when needed.
- **FakeNitro and other Vencord plugins:** FakeNitro and Apple Emojis have recently been implemented into Voxa and other BetterDiscord/Vencord plugins are expected soon! See [Upcoming Features](#upcoming-features).

## Known Issues

- Some items are fully transparent, lacking any translucency or blur effects.
- Certain items have not been fully integrated with transparent/translucent features.
- Light mode has a few minor, easily resolvable issues.
  - To fix this, your macOS settings need to be the same as your Voxa settings. For example, if I want to use light mode on Voxa, my system settings also need to be on light mode.
